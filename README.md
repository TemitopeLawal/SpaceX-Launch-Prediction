# SpaceX-Launch-Prediction
This project is intended to find out if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if I can determine if the first stage will land, I can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch. The processes I carried out included collecting and and making sure the data was in the correct format from an API, carrying out data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), location analysis, and machine learning prediction.
